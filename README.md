# Student Score Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict student scores based on various features using regression models. The project uses Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict student scores based on input features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The project involves the following main steps:

1. Data Collection: The data for this project is collected from a dataset that contains information about student scores and related features. The dataset is in CSV format and is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.

2. Data Preprocessing: The loaded data is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical features, and any other data quality issues. This involves tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data is analyzed and visualized to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features. This step helps in identifying patterns and trends in the data that may impact the model's performance.

4. Feature Selection: Based on the insights gained from EDA, relevant features are selected for model training. This involves choosing the most important features that are likely to have a significant impact on the target variable (i.e., student scores).

5. Model Training: Several regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression, are implemented and trained using the preprocessed data. The models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting student scores.

6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using cross-validation and other evaluation techniques to assess their performance on unseen data. The model with the best performance is selected as the final model for making predictions.

7. Model Deployment: Once the final model is selected, it can be deployed in a production environment for making real-time predictions. This may involve integrating the model into a web application or other relevant platforms for practical use.
